Stockmarket
===========

YQL query from yahoo for stock prices, exchange rates and noble metal prices. There is work in progress.

Old code does not work anyway anymore.

UPDATE: found out the old URI does not work anymore.
There seems to be a working URI but I have not figured out if and how I can use it with this code.
